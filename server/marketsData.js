        Description: "One of our favorite food markets in Europe is the March√© Victor Hugo in Toulouse.  In addition to the usual fare (huge coils of local sausage, delicious breads, and decadent cakes), there is also a restaurant hall upstairs.  It seems that most locals while away a Sunday afternoon here lingering over a delicious three course menu (with wine of course!).",

        Description: "Located just off Las Ramblas, La Boqueria in Barcelona is a riot of colors and sound.  Fresh produce, juices, and sweets are of course on offer.  I remember also being jarred when I suddenly rounded a corner and stood face to face (literally) with a skinned goat's head.  You can find anything and everything in this large covered market hall.",
