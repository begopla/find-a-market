In addition to the usual fare (huge coils of local sausage, delicious breads, and decadent cakes), there is also a restaurant hall upstairs.  It seems that most locals while away a Sunday afternoon here lingering over a delicious three course menu (with wine of course!).",

I remember also being jarred when I suddenly rounded a corner and stood face to face (literally) with a skinned goat's head.  You can find anything and everything in this large covered market hall.",

Fortune tellers, snake charmers, poets, and storytellers come to entertain the crowds, helping to create an intoxicating atmosphere whose cultural importance inspired UNESCO to create its Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Jemaa el-Fna is located in the medina quarter of Marrakesh. The square is open daily and things typically get going at around 8 a.m. and continue until at least midnight. Pickpockets are common, especially after dark. Also be prepared to see some questionable practices among the snake charmers and monkey trainers, who sometimes treat their animals in a less than ethical way. Be careful when takeing photos! Always aks if it's ok to avoid argueing with snake charmers, monkey trainers, singers..",
